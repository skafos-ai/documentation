##### Deliver the power of machine learning to your mobile applications.
__

**Management**
* Upload custom models from any training environment to the [dashboard](https://dashboard.skafos.ai)
* Store and version models associated with your app

**Deployment**
* Deliver or roll-back model versions to application environments (dev or prod)
* Update models over-the-air without resubmitting your application to the app store

**Monitoring**
* Track active devices, model installations, and other analytics

A recommended functional architecture looks something like this:

# Platform Overview

### Organizations
You build with Skafos as an **Organization** (either an *individual* or a *team of collaborators*). For a given organization, Skafos has the following components:
- [Applications](#applications)
- [Environments](#environments)
- [Models](#models)
- [Model Versions](#model-versions)

### Applications
An **Application** on Skafos represents an iOS app integration. Create a new application for each new iOS app that has a unique [Bundle ID](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appstoreconnectapi/bundle_ids).

The structure for a *typical application* is shown on the left and a more *complex application* is shown on the right:

     style="left: left; margin-top: 15px; margin-bottom: 15px;"/>

### Environments
Utilize application **Environments** to manage model version deployments to either:
* **Dev**: Use this environment when building/testing your app in Xcode (with DEBUG flag as True).
* **Prod**: Use this environment when testing your app in [TestFlight](https://developer.apple.com/testflight/) or
when it's released to the [App Store](https://www.apple.com/ios/app-store/).

[Learn how to set Skafos environment keys](sections/integrate.md#set-environment-keys){:target="_blank"} in your iOS app.

### Models
**Models** represent a component of your application powered by a machine learning artifact.

- Each model is a collection of model versions as they are updated over time.
- Create a new Skafos model for each discrete ML-powered feature.

### Model Versions
**Model Versions** are deployable machine learning artifacts such as [Core ML](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/coreml){:target="_blank"}
 or [TensorFlow Lite](https://www.tensorflow.org/lite){:target="_blank"} files ready to run inference on-device.

- Model versions are automatically version-controlled once uploaded to the platform.
- Model versions may be assigned to environments.

# Development Tools
Skafos provides three development tools to get started.

### [Python SDK](https://sdk.skafos.ai)
A Python wrapper for uploading, fetching, and listing model versions from the platform. Install the SDK from [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/skafos/) using the pip package manager:
```bash
$ pip install skafos
```
Follow the link in the header to get to the SDK Documentation.

### [iOS Framework](https://github.com/skafos/ios)
An iOS framework for managing model deployments in your mobile application. Visit the [Integration Guide](sections/integrate.md){:target="_blank"} for usage details.

### [Dashboard](https://dashboard.skafos.ai)
A web-based user interface designed to help you do the following:

##### Create New App Integrations

<img src="assets/new_app.png" width="40%"/>

  - Start with an example app
  - Bring your own; start with a custom app

##### Manage & Deploy Models

<img src="assets/deploy.png" width="120%"/>

  - Version and organize your models and applications
  - Deploy or roll-back model versions to different environments

##### Send Background Updates

<img src="assets/deploy_with_push.png" height="400" />

  - Push an asset to iOS devices through Apple's Prod or Dev Push Notification Service.
  - Increase model adoption rate by having devices download them automatically in the background
  - Notifies devices via a silent push, your users won't see it

[Learn how to enable push notification model updates](sections/push_notifications.md){:target="_blank"} for your app.

##### Monitor Models & Devices

<img src="assets/BasicMonitoringFinal.png" width="100%"/>

- Track *total installations* and *iOS specs* (device type and iOS version) for active devices using your deployed models
- View the adoption rate of your newly deployed model versions
